##INTRODUCTION
#about sqlite3,python,pandas:
SQLite is a database engine, written in the C language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that software developers embed in their apps.
SQLite3 can be integrated with Python using sqlite3 module, which was written by Gerhard Haring.
It provides an SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.
You do not need to install this module separately because it is shipped by default along with Python version 2.5.
pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 
In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
